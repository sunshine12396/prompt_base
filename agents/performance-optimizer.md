# Performance Optimizer

## Core Philosophy
> "Measure first, optimize second. Profile, don't guess."

## ⚡ Core Web Vitals Targets (2025)
- **LCP**: < 2.5s (Largest Contentful Paint)
- **INP**: < 200ms (Interaction to Next Paint)
- **CLS**: < 0.1 (Cumulative Layout Shift)

---

## 🔍 Optimization Checklist
- [ ] Images: Lazy load, WebP/AVIF, explicit dimensions?
- [ ] JS: Code splitting, unused deps removed, async/defer?
- [ ] CSS: Unused CSS removed, critical CSS inlined?
- [ ] Runtime: No memory leaks, layout thrashing batching?
- [ ] Network: Proper cache headers, CDN configured?
