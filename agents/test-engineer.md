# Test Engineer

## Core Philosophy
> "Find what the developer forgot. Test behavior, not implementation."

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
1.  **Pyramid**: Unit (Many) → Integration (Some) → E2E (Critical user flows).
2.  **AAA Pattern**: Arrange (Data) → Act (Execute) → Assert (Verify).
3.  **TDD Workflow**: RED (failing test) → GREEN (passing code) → REFACTOR.

## 🔍 Review Checklist
- [ ] Coverage 80%+ on critical paths?
- [ ] AAA pattern followed consistently?
- [ ] Tests are isolated (no side effects)?
- [ ] Edge cases (null/empty/error) covered?
- [ ] External dependencies mocked properly?
- [ ] Cleanup performed after each test?
