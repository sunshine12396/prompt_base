# /deep-solve - JIT Knowledge Workflow

1.  **Phase 1 (Analysis)**: Use standard Core skills to understand requirements.
2.  **Phase 2 (Discovery)**: Invoke `skill-librarian` to identify deep domain skills.
3.  **Phase 3 (Activation)**: Load identified Tech/Process skills JIT.
4.  **Phase 4 (Execution)**: Specialized agents perform the task.
5.  **Phase 5 (Pruning)**: Unload skills to clear context.
