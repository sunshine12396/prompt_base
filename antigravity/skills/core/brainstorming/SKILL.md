# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"

Every project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change — all of them. "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get approval.

## Checklist

You MUST complete these items in order:

1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria
3. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation
4. **Present design** — in sections scaled to complexity, get user approval after each section
5. **Write design doc** — save to `docs/PLAN-<topic>.md` and commit
6. **Spec self-review** — check for placeholders, contradictions, ambiguity, scope
7. **User reviews written spec** — ask user to review before proceeding
8. **Transition to implementation** — invoke plan-writing skill

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Before asking detailed questions, assess scope: if the request describes multiple independent subsystems, flag this immediately
- If too large for a single spec, help the user decompose into sub-projects
- Ask questions **one at a time** to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible
- Only one question per message
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**

- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

**Design for isolation and clarity:**

- Break the system into smaller units with one clear purpose each
- Well-defined interfaces between units
- Each unit testable independently
- Smaller, well-bounded units are easier to work with — you reason better about code you can hold in context

**Working in existing codebases:**

- Explore the current structure before proposing changes. Follow existing patterns.
- Where existing code has problems that affect the work, include targeted improvements
- Don't propose unrelated refactoring. Stay focused on what serves the current goal.

## After the Design

**Spec Self-Review:**
After writing the spec document, review with fresh eyes:

1. **Placeholder scan:** Any "TBD", "TODO", incomplete sections? Fix them.
2. **Internal consistency:** Do any sections contradict each other?
3. **Scope check:** Is this focused enough for a single implementation plan?
4. **Ambiguity check:** Could any requirement be interpreted two different ways? Pick one.

**User Review Gate:**
After review passes, ask the user to review the written spec:

> "Spec written to `<path>`. Please review and let me know if you want changes before we write the implementation plan."

Wait for user response. Only proceed once user approves.

**Implementation:**
- Invoke the plan-writing skill to create a detailed implementation plan
- Do NOT invoke any other skill. plan-writing is the next step.

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** — Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** — Easier to answer than open-ended
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** — Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** — Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** — Present design, get approval before moving on

## Red Flags

- Jumping to code without presenting a design
- Asking 5 questions at once
- Skipping the spec self-review
- Proceeding without user approval of written spec
- "This is too simple to need a design"
- Not exploring the existing codebase first
- Proposing only one approach without alternatives

## Error Handling

| Category | Response Strategy |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Port Conflict** | Offer alternative port or close existing |
| **Dependency Missing** | Auto-install or ask permission |
| **Build Failure** | Show specific error + suggested fix |
| **Unclear Error** | Ask for specifics: screenshot, console output |

## Completion Structure

```
1. Success confirmation (celebrate briefly)
2. Summary of what was done (concrete)
3. How to verify/test (actionable)
4. Next steps suggestion (proactive)
```
