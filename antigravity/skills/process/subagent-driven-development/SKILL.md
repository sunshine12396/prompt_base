# Subagent-Driven Development

Execute plan by dispatching fresh subagent per task, with two-stage review after each: spec compliance review first, then code quality review.

**Why subagents:** Delegate tasks to specialized agents with isolated context. By precisely crafting their instructions and context, you ensure they stay focused. They should never inherit your session's context — you construct exactly what they need.

**Core principle:** Fresh subagent per task + two-stage review (spec then quality) = high quality, fast iteration

## When to Use

- Have an implementation plan with independent tasks
- Tasks are mostly independent (not tightly coupled)
- Want to stay in the current session

**vs. Inline Execution:**
- Fresh subagent per task (no context pollution)
- Two-stage review after each task
- Faster iteration (no human-in-loop between tasks)

## The Process

```
1. Read plan, extract all tasks with full text, create task list
2. FOR EACH TASK:
   a. Dispatch implementer subagent (with full task text + context)
   b. Handle implementer status (DONE / BLOCKED / NEEDS_CONTEXT)
   c. Dispatch spec reviewer subagent → verify code matches spec
   d. If spec issues → implementer fixes → re-review
   e. Dispatch code quality reviewer subagent
   f. If quality issues → implementer fixes → re-review
   g. Mark task complete
3. After all tasks → final code review of entire implementation
4. Finish development branch
```

## Handling Implementer Status

**DONE:** Proceed to spec compliance review.

**DONE_WITH_CONCERNS:** Read concerns before proceeding. If about correctness/scope, address first. If observations, note and proceed.

**NEEDS_CONTEXT:** Provide missing context and re-dispatch.

**BLOCKED:** Assess the blocker:
1. Context problem → provide more context, re-dispatch
2. Needs more reasoning → re-dispatch with more capable model
3. Task too large → break into smaller pieces
4. Plan itself wrong → escalate to user

**Never** ignore an escalation or force retry without changes.

## Implementer Prompt Template

```
You are implementing Task N: [task name]

## Task Description
[FULL TEXT of task from plan - paste it, don't make subagent read file]

## Context
[Scene-setting: where this fits, dependencies, architectural context]

## Before You Begin
If you have questions about requirements, approach, dependencies, or anything
unclear — ask them now. Raise any concerns before starting work.

## Your Job
1. Implement exactly what the task specifies
2. Write tests (following TDD if task says to)
3. Verify implementation works
4. Commit your work
5. Self-review (completeness, quality, discipline, testing)
6. Report back

## When You're in Over Your Head
It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me."
Bad work is worse than no work.

## Report Format
- **Status:** DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
- What you implemented
- What you tested and test results
- Files changed
- Self-review findings
- Any issues or concerns
```

## Spec Reviewer Prompt Template

```
You are reviewing whether an implementation matches its specification.

## What Was Requested
[FULL TEXT of task requirements]

## What Implementer Claims They Built
[From implementer's report]

## CRITICAL: Do Not Trust the Report
The implementer may be incomplete, inaccurate, or optimistic.
You MUST verify everything independently.

**DO NOT:** Take their word, trust claims, accept their interpretation
**DO:** Read actual code, compare to requirements line by line

Report:
- ✅ Spec compliant (if everything matches after code inspection)
- ❌ Issues found: [list what's missing or extra, with file:line references]
```

## Code Quality Reviewer Template

**Only dispatch after spec compliance review passes.**

```
Review the implementation for code quality:

## What Was Implemented
[From implementer's report]

## Review Focus
- Does each file have one clear responsibility?
- Are units decomposed so they can be tested independently?
- Is the implementation clean and maintainable?
- Names clear and accurate?
- Tests verify behavior (not just mock behavior)?
- No over-engineering (YAGNI)?

Report:
- Strengths
- Issues (Critical / Important / Minor)
- Assessment (Approved / Needs fixes)
```

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Skip reviews (spec compliance OR code quality)
- Proceed with unfixed issues
- Dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel (conflicts)
- Make subagent read plan file (provide full text instead)
- Skip scene-setting context
- Ignore subagent questions
- Accept "close enough" on spec compliance
- Skip review loops (reviewer found issues = fix = review again)
- **Start code quality review before spec compliance is ✅**
- Move to next task while either review has open issues

**If subagent asks questions:** Answer clearly and completely.

**If reviewer finds issues:** Implementer fixes → reviewer reviews again → repeat until approved.

**If subagent fails task:** Dispatch fix subagent with specific instructions. Don't fix manually (context pollution).

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**
- **plan-writing** — Creates the plan this skill executes
- **tdd-workflow** — Subagents follow TDD for each task
- **verification-before-completion** — Verify before claiming success
