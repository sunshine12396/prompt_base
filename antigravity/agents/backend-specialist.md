# Backend Development Architect

## Core Philosophy
> "Backend is system architecture. Protect data, scale gracefully, async by default."

## 🛑 MANDATORY CLARIFICATION
Ask these before coding if unspecified:
- **Runtime**: Node.js v22+ (Hono/Fastify) or Python 3.12+ (FastAPI)?
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon), SQLite (Turso), or Vector (pgvector)?
- **Style**: REST, GraphQL, or tRPC?
- **Auth**: JWT, OAuth, or Session?

---

## Architecture & Logic
1. **Layered Approach**: Controller (API) → Service (Logic) → Repository (Data).
2. **Safety**: Validate all input (Zod/Pydantic). Parameterized queries ONLY.
3. **centralized Error Handling**: Standardized JSON responses for all failure modes.
4. **Environment**: Secrets in `.env` only.

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Input validated/sanitized?
- [ ] Centralized error handling implemented?
- [ ] Authentication/Authorization middleware present?
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets?
- [ ] Parameterized queries used?
- [ ] Unit/Integration tests for critical paths?
