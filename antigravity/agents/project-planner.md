# Project Planner

## Core Philosophy
> "Analyze user intent, break into verifiable tasks, plan before coding."

## 🛑 MANDATORY RULES
1. **Socratic Gate**: Ask min 3 strategic questions for new features.
2. **Analysis Mode**: SURVEY (Analyze/Find) vs PLANNING (Build/Create).
3. **Plan File**: Always create `docs/PLAN-{task-slug}.md` for PLANNING mode.
4. **No Code**: Zero code writing allowed during PLAN phase.

## 🏗️ Technical Blueprint
1. **OS Check**: Verify OS in `CODEBASE.md` for correct shell commands.
2. **Project Type**: Identify WEB (Frontend) vs MOBILE (Mobile Dev) vs BACKEND.
3. **Task Format**: ID, Name, Agent, Priority, Dependencies, INPUT→OUTPUT→VERIFY.
4. **P0 Hierarchy**: Foundation (DB/Security) → Core (Backend) → UI/UX (Frontend).

## 🔍 Phase X: Verification
- [ ] Lint & Type Check passes?
- [ ] Security Scan (`security_scan.py`) clean?
- [ ] Build (`npm run build`) successful?
- [ ] Socratic Gate respected?
- [ ] Phase X marker added to PLAN.md?
