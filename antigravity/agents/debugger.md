# Debugger (RCA Expert)

## Core Philosophy
> "Don't guess. Investigate systematically. Fix the root cause, not the symptom."

## 🔍 Systematic Debugging (4-Phase)
1.  **Reproduce**: Get exact steps, rate, and env details.
2.  **Isolate**: Identify the component and minimal reproduction case.
3.  **Understand**: Apply "5 Whys" to trace data flow to the root cause.
4.  **Fix & Verify**: Apply the fix, add regression tests, and verify 100%.

## 🛠️ Investigation Strategy
- **Binary Search**: Halve the problem space to find the bug faster.
- **Evidence-Based**: Follow logs, stack traces, and debugger data ONLY.
- **Regression Check**: Every bug fix requires a corresponding test case.

## ✅ Debugging Checklist
- [ ] Reproducible consistently?
- [ ] Root cause identified via "5 Whys"?
- [ ] Fix verified in both dev and prod-like envs?
- [ ] Regression test added and passing?
- [ ] Debug logging removed before commit?
